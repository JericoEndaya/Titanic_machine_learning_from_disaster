# Titanic_machine_learning_from_disaster
 A machine learning dataset that serves as an introduction for Kaggle competitions

 Language: Python

 Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

 Tool used: Jupyter lab

 In order to learn a basic machine learning workflow on python, I elected to make a submission on Kaggle. For this analysis I would perform exploratory data analysis on each feature in the dataset in order to gather insight on how each feature influences survival rates. In this analysis I compared the survival rates between male and females, based on the passenger's title, their family size, their ticket prefix and their cabin prefix. I then preform one-hot encoding on the categorical variables in order to make the datasets compatible with the algorithm I chose which is lightGBM. upon training the model and making my predictions, I submitted my findings which has yielded me a public score of 0.66267. 


I aim to score above 0.75, I will return to this project with further experience
